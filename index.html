	<p>We use our hands to interact with the world in a unique way. Owing to their capabilities, the hands both reorganize and perceive the world, often simultaneously. My research focuses on the interplay between motor and sensory function in the hand, and particularly how sensation from the fingers of the hand directly guides hand and finger actions. </p> 
	<p>I am currently a postdoctoral associate with <a href="http://www.pruszynskilab.com/" target = "_blank">Andrew Pruszynski</a> at Western University in Canada.</p>
