	<h1>Brain, feel world</h1>
	<p>Hello! I study how the hand mediates interactions between the central nervous system and the outside world (and vice versa). I am a postdoctoral associate with <a href="http://www.pruszynskilab.com/">Andrew Pruszynski</a> at Western University in Canada. Please bear with me as I construct this site..<a href="/about">.</a></p>
