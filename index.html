	<p>Our hands are extremely complex, sensitive, and versatile. I study how the kinematic and sensory properties of the hand mediates interactions between the central nervous system and the outside world (and vice versa). I am currently a postdoctoral associate with <a href="http://www.pruszynskilab.com/" target = "_blank">Andrew Pruszynski</a> at Western University in Canada.</p>
