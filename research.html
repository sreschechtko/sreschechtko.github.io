	<h2>Multi-Finger Sensation</h2>
	<p>How do our fingers work together to explore objects and discover affordances for object manipulation? Each finger has a multitude of sensory endings and can be articulated relatively independently, but creating a cohesive schema of an object in the hand requires integration of information from skin on the fingers with information about where the fingers are in space. I am designing and running experiments to understand whether and how the nervous system integrates this information, and to determine the role of active manipulation in creating cohesive object schema.</p>

	<h2>Motion Capture for Hands</h2>
	<p>Classical motion capture methods are difficult to apply to the hands and often interfere with sensation on glabrous skin. Markerless tracking is making rapid progress, but the focus has mostly been on wide applicability or nonhuman animals. The hands pose unique challenges for markerless technology because hand morphology varies widely and hand configurations change so much during ecological use. I am working to determine the hardware and training set requirements for robust markerless motion capture of the hands</p>

	<h2>Ecological Tasks in the Laboratory</h2>
	<p>Many ecological tasks (especially those involving dextrous manipulation) can be performed in the lab with minimal compromises, and motor tasks can interrogate the sensory system at a level unavailable with classical psychophysics. I am developing well-calibrated laboratory tests that can play a role in clinical diagnosis.</p>
