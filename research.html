<h2>Multi-Finger Sensation</h2>
<p>How do our fingers work together to explore objects and discover affordances for object manipulation? Each finger has a multitude of sensory endings and can be articulated relatively independently, but creating a cohesive schema of an object in the hand requires integration of information from skin on the fingers with information about where the fingers are in space. How does the nervous system integrate this information, and what is the role of active manipulation in creating such schema?</p>

<h2>Motion Capture for Hands</h2>
<p>Classical motion capture methods (optical markers, magnetic trackers, and gloves) are difficult to apply to the hands and often interfere with sensation on glabrous skin, which makes it impossible to study the subtle, bidirectional interactions between object and hand in dextrous manipulation. Markerless tracking is making rapid progress, but the focus has mostly been on wide applicability or nonhuman animals. The hands also pose unique challenges for markerless technology because hand morphology varies widely and hand configurations change so much during ecological use.</p>

<h2>Ecological Tasks in the Laboratory</h2>
<p>Markerless motion capture and experiments "in the field" are a holy grail for many movement science research, but controlled laboratory settings can still be extremely informative. Many ecological tasks (especially those involving dextrous manipulation) can be performed in the lab with minimal compromises, and motor tasks can interrogate the sensory system at a level unavailable with classical psychophysics. For this reason, well-calibrated laboratory tests can also play an important role in clinical diagnosis.</p>
