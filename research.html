	<h1>Research Interests</h1>

	<p>How does the physical constitution of the hand inform hand use, and what can we learn about the hand by observing natural behavior? My research addresses these questions along three axes:</p>
		
	<h2>Coordinated Use of Fingers</h2>
	<p>During graduate school, I extensively studied how we use our fingers together in simple tasks like applying constant force to a surface, and how the availability of different sensory modalities support such coordination. While these studies continue to shape my research, my current research primarily focuses on the role of somatosensation in naturalistic hand use.</p>

	<h2>Active Sensation Across the Hand</h2>
	<p>When putting a key into a lock, you likely use your thumb and index finger; when you drop that key in the grass, though, you might use all fingers together to search for it. Despite the intuitive and automatic nature of these different strategies, little is known about how they reflect differences in sensorimotor ability across the fingers. This is especially apparent in the case of “active touch” when we move our fingers across stimuli rather than experiencing stimuli pressed against the stationary fingertips. I aim to quantify sensory ability across the fingertips, physical fingertip properties, and control of individual fingers to better understanding how the properties of the fingers affect our behavioral strategies.</p>

	<h2>Sensorimotor Integration for Hand Use</h2>
	<p>In everyday life, we rely on sensation from the fingers to guide finger action – but at what level(s) of the nervous system does this integration occur? How does sensation from one finger guide actions from other fingers? Cutaneous reflexes and other fast feedback responses to tactile stimuli can help answer these questions because motor tasks can interrogate the sensory system at a level unavailable to classical psychophysics which rely on conscious report. My goal is to use these findings to develop clinical tests of sensation to improve diagnosis and understanding of sensory neuropathies.</p>
