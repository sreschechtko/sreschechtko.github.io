	<h1>About</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado and have always been fascinated with how we physically interact with the world. As an undegraduate, I studied Philosophy of Mind and Language at the University of Chicago; I subsequently persued my graduate studies in Motor Control and Neuroscience of Movement at Penn State University. My transition from philosophy to neuroscience was less than dramatic that one might imagine because, in both cases, I was studying how the physical world shapes our behaviors. I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Western University in Canada, where I continute to study our interactions with the world and specifically how the hand shapes these interactions.</p>
