	<h1>About</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado and have always been fascinated with how our interactions with the world are shaped by our physical constitution. As an undegraduate, I studied Philosophy of Mind and Language at the University of Chicago, where I got my B.A.; I subsequently studied Motor Control and Neuroscience of Movement at Penn State University, where I got my M.S. and Ph.D. My transition from philosophy to neuroscience was less than dramatic that one might imagine because I continued to study how our intentions are instantiated in the physical world and how that physical world shapes our behaviors. I am currently an assistant professor at San Diego State University, where I study how the biological implementation of the hand shapes our interactions with the world.</p>
